==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*idwintab-introduction*

*idwintab* is a Vim plugin to give unique ID for each window and tab page to
identify one of them.  Because the returning values of Vim's built-in
functions such as |winnr()| and |tabpagenr()| are calculated by their
positions, so that the values aren't invariant.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.0 or later

Latest version:
