	{state} is like [flag] for |:Flydiff|:
	- If {state} is "on", start on-the-fly diff.
	- If {state} is "off", stop on-the-fly diff.
	- Otherwise, toggle on-the-fly diff.

CHANGELOG					*flydiff-changelog*

0.0.1	2008-06-28T03:46:26+09:00		*flydiff-changelog-0.0.1*
	Fix many minor bugs:
	- Set 'nobuflist' for diff buffers.
	- Change naming style for diff buffers.
	- Don't create diff buffers until they are really necessary.
	- Don't create extra unnamed buffers.
	- Perform on-the-fly diff forcedly for the first time even if a base
	  buffer is not modified.
	- Don't show a message by :update while performing on-the-fly diff.
	- Show a message in a diff buffer if there is no difference in the
	  corresponding base buffer.
	- Adjust the cursor in a diff buffer to point the line which is
	  equivalent to the cursor position in the corresponding base buffer.
	  This behavior is useful if there are many differences and they are
	  not showed in a diff buffer window at once.
	- Revise some error messages.
	- Revise internal stuffs.

0.0	2008-06-25T21:07:55+09:00		*flydiff-changelog-0.0*
	- Initial version.
