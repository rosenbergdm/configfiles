<span class="hed">NAME</span>
       <span class=
"red">open</span> - command-line equivalent of double-clicking to open OS X applica-
       tions, files, urls,  x-windows  unix  programs,  preference  panes  and
       directories.   This is an enhanced version (a superset) of Apple's <span class="red">open</span>
       command, and (unlike Apple's version) uses a powerful and nuanced  <span class="red">cus-</span>
       <span class="red">tomizable</span> <span class=
"red">command</span> <span class=
"red">completion</span> <span class=
"red">mechanism</span> for the <span class=
"red">open</span> command.

<span class="hed">SYNOPSIS</span>
       <span class="red">open</span> <span class=
"red">[</span> -aeFfpswxh <span class="red">]</span> <span class=
"red">[</span> <u>application-name</u> <span class=
"red">]</span> <u>file</u> <span class="red">...</span>

<span class="hed">DESCRIPTION</span>
       The  <span class=
"red">open</span>  function  augments  Apple's  distributed open command with a
       super-set of functionality.  It opens a file (or a  directory,  Prefer-
       ence  Pane,  Application,  Widget  or  URL), just as if you had double-
       clicked the file's icon. The augmented version incorporates a  powerful
       zsh command completion system. If no application name is specified, the
       default application as determined via LaunchServices is  used  to  open
       the  specified  files.  This works with a programmed command completion
       for all OS X Application names.   This  mechanism  in  turn  relies  on
       mdfind in 10.4 and above, or an up-to-date locatedb in 10.3.

       The  distributed function <span class=
"red">enable_faster_open</span> can be run to aid the user
       in taking full advantage of the open completion mechanism  and  ensures
       that  it  operates  optimally.   In  10.4 this is done with a dedicated
       launchd item, and in 10.3 it is done using the locatedb.

       If the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a  URL.

       If the name of a PreferencePane is given with the -p flag, System Pref-
       erences will open to that pane.  This works with a  command  completion
       for each installed PreferencePane.

       You can specify one or more file names (or pathnames), which are inter-
       preted relative to the  shell  or  Terminal  window's  current  working
       directory. For example, the following command would open all Word files
       in the current working directory:

       open *.doc

<span class="hed">HISTORY</span>
       Apple's <span class=
"red">open</span> command first appeared in NextStep, and is distributed  in
       OS  X  Darwin.  The <span class=
"red">open</span> function was written as a shell-script wrapper
       for Apple's <span class=
"red">open</span> to include  additional  functionality,  and  has  been
       incorporated,  along with an elaborate set of command completions, as a
       <span class="red">zsh</span> <span class=
"red">function</span> in the <u>zsh-templates</u> <u>package.</u>   The  completions  for  the
       <span class=
"red">open</span>  command  were written by Motoi Washida (Nov 12, 2004 CVS version)
       and subsequently modified by W. G. Scott, Wataru Kagawa and others.






<span class="hed">AUTHORS</span>
       The <span class=
"red">open</span> command is Copyright (c) 2001 Apple Computer, Inc. All  Rights
       Reserved.   The  <span class=
"red">open</span>  shell  script is a wrapper for the original <span class="red">open</span>
       program, which remains unaltered.  The <span class=
"red">open</span> shell script (and zsh func-
       tion) was written by W. G. Scott and is public domain.

       The  <span class=
"red">_open</span>  command  completion  function was re-written by W. G. Scott
       based on that of Motoi Washida.  The other functions that _open depends
       on  were  written  entirely by Motoi Washida, except for <span class="red">comp_appgetter</span>
       which was written by W. G. Scott.
