.SH NAME
.B user_setup
\- Customize completions that use the _users completion with GUI

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B user_setup


.SH DESCRIPTION  

.B user_setup
generates a GUI assistant to enable the user to easily configure the zsh completion system for completions that use a list of usernames.  This is handy due to the large number of "fake" users present in /etc/hosts.  Checkboxes are presented that permit the user to chose from what is generated by zsh by default, or to define a customized set of users.  (As a starting point, the customization list displays the users found under the /User directory, but any names can be added or deleted.)  A button is provided to revert to the default (zsh) settings.
