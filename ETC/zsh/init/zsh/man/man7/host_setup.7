.SH NAME
.B host_setup
\- Customize completions that use the _hosts completion with a GUI assistant

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B host_setup


.SH DESCRIPTION  

.B host_setup
generates a GUI assistant to enable the user to easily configure the zsh completion system for completions that use a list of hostnames. Checkboxes are presented that permit the user to chose from what is generated by zsh by default (from the /etc/hosts file), or to define a customized set of hosts.  (As a starting point, the customization list displays the hosts found in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, but any names can be added or deleted.)  A button is provided to revert to the default (zsh) settings.
