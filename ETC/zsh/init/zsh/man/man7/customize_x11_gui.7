.SH NAME
.B customize_x11_gui
\- Assist the user in changing (improving) the behavior of Apple's X11.app -- GUI version

.SH SYNOPSIS

customize_x11_gui

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B customize_x11_gui
is GUI-wrapped shell script that assists the user in changing settings that
govern the behavior of X11.  It prompts the user before making any change, and
explains the options carefully.

.B customize_x11_gui
will ask the user if X11 should be added to the user's startup items, whether focus follows
mouse behavior (emulating canonical X11 unix systems) should be set, whether the user should
be warned on logout if X11 is running, whether X11 should be run as a dockless and menuless
application in the background, as so forth.  Re-running the function will permit the user to
restore default behaviors.

The gui version will create entries in .cshrc, .bashrc, .bash_profile, and .zshrc to set
the 
.B DISPLAY
variable correctly for multiple users when simultanously logged in using Fast User Switching
and X11.app.

.SH URL
There is a web page that explains this in more detail and provides a screen shot of the gui.
