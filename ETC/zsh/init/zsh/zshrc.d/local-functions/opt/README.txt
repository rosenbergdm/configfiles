This directory contains functions and completion functions that
I have termed optional (hence ./opt ) or "possibly annoying."
The reason is that many of these change default unix command
behavior into something you might not like.  These functions
are not autoloaded by default, but can be by changing the
default setting in $ZDOT/functions.local.  Even then, some
are commented out (I use only a subset of these myself).
Be sure you understand what a function does before making it
part of your default settings, or you may find you experience
unexpected behavior from one of these commands.
